        h1.title Seven Times Have I Dispised My Soul
        h2.byline Kahlil Gibran, 1883-1931
        p.paragraph The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.
        p.paragraph The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.
        p.paragraph The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.
        p.paragraph The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.
        p.paragraph The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.
        p.paragraph The sixth time when she dispised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.
        p.paragraph And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.
